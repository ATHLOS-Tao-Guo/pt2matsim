## PT2MATSim

A package to convert input schedule data such as GTFS , HAFAS or OSM to a completely mapped MATSim schedule.

The implementation allows to first create a multi-modal network from OSM and then to map the schedule data onto that network. Tools to validate and edit the mapped schedule are also part of the package.
