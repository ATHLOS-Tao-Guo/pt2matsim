# PT2MATSim

A package to convert input schedule data such as GTFS, HAFAS or OSM to a completely mapped MATSim schedule.

There are mulitiple public transit schedule data formats, widely used formats are GTFS and HAFAS. Numerous GTFS feeds are
publicly available (see transit.land), otherwise these files have to be obtained from the public transit agency. The Swiss
public transit schedule is available in HAFAS format via fahrplanfelder.ch. Public transit data feeds can be converted to
unmapped MATSim transit schedules using _Gtfs2Transitschedule_ or _Hafas2TransitSchedule_. It is possible to convert public
transit information from OpenStreetMap files (_Osm2TransitSchedule_). However, OSM currently does not contain any temporal
information, the accuracy of the schedule data varies and is usually not sufficient to be used for simulations.

Unmapped MATSim transit schedule lack information on the links used by vehicles and only contain the stop sequence
for transit routes. Generating these links (i.e. the path a vehicle takes on a network) is called "mapping", a process
done by the _PublicTransitMapper_. It implements an algorithm that uses an abstract graph to calculate the least cost path
from the transit route's first to its last stop with the constraint that the path must contain a so called link candidate
for every stop. The result is a mapped transit schedule and a modified network.

Tools to validate and rudimentarily edit the mapped schedule are also part of the package.


### Standalone Usage

The tools can be used as a maven package or as a standalone utility. In order to create
a standalone version the repository needs to be cloned. Afterwards, maven can be used
to create a runnable jar:

    mvn -Prelease -DskipTests=true

The runnable tools are then located in

    pt2matsim/target/pt2matsim-VERSION-release.zip

The zip file contains the runnable jar and its dependencies in the `lib/` folder.
The tools can then be run in the following way:

    java -cp pt2matsim-VERSION.jar:libs org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Gtfs2TransitSchedule

## 1) Creating a multimodal network

The converter is based on the OSM network by M. Rieser (_org.matsim.core.utils.io.OsmNetworkReader_). However, some changes
have been made: The default values for links as well as parameters are stored in a _config.xml_ file. This file allows to
define whether an opposite link should be created and to set values for capacity, freespeed and the number of lanes
for _highway=*_ and _railway=*_ tags. This also allows to convert rail links. In addition, ways that are only used by
buses (i.e. are part of a relation tagged with _route=*_ in OSM) are included in a network. If information on number of lanes 
or freespeed is available for an OSM way, it is used for the MATSim link. 

It is recommended to simplify the network by inserting only one link instead of multiple links between two intersections. 
The Euclidian distance between the new link's end nodes will less than the the summed up length of the replaced links but 
the original length can be stored in the length attribute of the new link.

A default config file can be created by running

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CreateDefaultOsmConfig
    
The converter can be run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Osm2MultimodalNetwork
    
with the config file path as argument.   

## 2) Creating an unmapped MATSim transit schedule

### From GTFS

The GTFS converter's main job is transforming GTFS trips to MATSim transit routes. Trips and transit routes are not
equivalent: A trip defines the stop sequence and the departure time for a vehicle while a MATSim transit route defines
the stop sequence but usually has more than one departure time. The time offsets between stops is stored in the
routeProfile within the transit route in MATSim. GTFS offers two ways: Either with explicit time stamps in
stop_times.txt or as frequencies in frequencies.txt. The converter can use both. Finally, routes in GTFS are like
transit lines in MATSim. Stops are converted straight to stop facilities. GTFS offers no explicit information that could
be used as isBlocking value for MATSim stop facilities, so false is set by default.

For each trip, a service id defines on which days the trip is carried out. MATSim normally only simulates one day,
therefore one sample day has to be extracted from the GTFS feed. Although possible, it is not recommended to use
all trips in the feed. The following methods are suggested:

- Define the date to extract all affected trips from it.
- Use the day on which most services run.
- Use the day on which most trips are carried out.

The converter can be run by calling the main() method of

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Gtfs2TransitSchedule

with the following arguments:

    [0] folder where the gtfs files are located (a single zip file is not supported)
    [1]	Which service ids should be used. One of the following:
    	- date in the format "yyyymmdd"
    	- "dayWithMostServices"
    	- "dayWithMostTrips"
    	- "all"
    [2] the output coordinate system. Use "WGS84" for no transformation. EPGS:* codes are supported.
    [3] output transit schedule file
    [4] output default vehicles file (optional)
    [5] output shape reference file. A CSV file that references transit routes to shape ids. Can
        be used by certain PTMapper implementations and MappingAnalysis (optional)


### From HAFAS
HAFAS is a data format used by Swiss public transit agencies (particularly SBB) and other agencies in Europe (e.g. Deutsche Bahn).
Data is given in ASCII text files that contain information about operators, stops, vehicles and stop sequences, stop times and
additional information. HAFAS data for Switzerland is publicly available and provided by SBB. A report that
comes with this exported data provides information on the structure of the files.

Stop facilities are created from the stops defined in the file BFKOORD_GEO (uses WGS84). The transit lines, routes, departures and stop sequences
are generated from _FPLAN_. The file _BETRIEB_DE_ is used to add the agency's name to the transit line id. The reference day is
extracted using _BITFELD_. A default transport mode is assigned to each transit route depending on the vehicle defined in
HAFAS. The transport modes correspond to one of the eight transport modes defined in GTFS (see [GTFS reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/routes-file)).
Optionally, a default vehicle file is provided using predefined values (based on data provided by M. Rieser and P. BÃ¶sch) for different vehicle types 
such as interregional trains, S-Bahn trains or trolley buses.

Converts all files in _hafasFolder_ and writes the output schedule and vehicle file. Stop Facility coordinates are transformed to _outputCoordinateSystem_.

The converter can be run by calling the main() method of

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Hafas2TransitSchedule

with the following arguments:

    [0] hafasFolder
    [1] outputCoordinateSystem. Use "WGS84" for no transformation. EPGS:* codes are supported.
    [2] outputScheduleFile
    [3] outputVehicleFile

### From OSM

OSM offers tags to specify spatial public transit data on stop locations and transit routes. The converter provided as 
part of the package creates an unmapped transit schedule from OSM data. It creates stop facilities from _OSM_ nodes with 
the tag _public\_transport=stop\_position_. Relations with the tag _route=*_ are converted to transit routes. These transit 
routes contain only stop sequences. Link sequences are not converted even if they are available. The transport mode is set 
based on the respective _route=*_ tag value of the relation.

The quality of the generated transit schedule for a region depends largely on the accuracy of the data in _OSM_. Often 
route data is either inconsistent or not even available. The lack of naming conventions further complicates using the data. 
In addition, _OSM_ does not offer any tags to store temporal information. Thus, departure times and stop offsets have to be 
gathered from other sources.

The converter can be run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Osm2TransitSchedule
    
with the following arguments    

    [0] osm file
	[1] output schedule file
	[2] output coordinate system (optional)
    
## 3) Mapping a transit schedule to a network

### Public Transit Mapper

All input parameters are defined in a config file, a default config file can be created via
    
    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CreateDefaultPTMapperConfig
    
The whole schedule is mapped to the network. In cases where only subsets should be used (e.g. for a region), 
the schedule needs to be filtered beforehand.

The Public Transit Mapper is run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.PublicTransitMapper

with a config file as input argument.

#### Link candidates
First, a set of link candidates is created for each stop facility and schedule transport mode. For all nodes within 
_nodeSearchRadius_ the in- and outlinks are fetched and sorted in ascending order by their distance from the stop facility. 
The other link candidates search parameters are defined for each schedule mode in the respective _linkCandidateCreator_ 
parameterset. _maxNClosestLinks_ defines how many links should be considered for each stop facility. This limit is not 
strictly enforced: When the limit is reached, the last link's opposite link is still added to the set. Further, after 
the limit has been reached, the distance of the farthest link to the stop facility is multiplied by _linkDistanceTolerance_ 
and all additional links within this distance are added as well. This is used as a soft constraint to include links with 
almost the same distance from the stop facility. However, no links farther than _maxLinkCandidateDistance_ from the stop 
facility are used.

The implementation allows to manually define link candidate beforehand in the config (in a _manualLinkCandidates_ parameterset 
or a separate csv file (parameter _manualLinkCandidate_CsvFile_). This helps mapping with complicated rail stations. Stop 
facilities with no link within _maxLinkCandidateDistance_ are given a dummy loop link at their coordinates: A node is added 
at the coordinate and a dummy loop link is added to the network with the added node as source and destination. The loop link 
is referenced to the stop facility and is set as its only link candidate. _useArtificialLoopLink_ defines if such an artificial 
loop link should be created regardless of the other parameters. Tram, subway, ferry, funicular and gondola routes are normally 
mapped with artificial links.

#### Creating mode dependent router
The config parameterset _modeRoutingAssignment_ defines for a transport mode what links a transit route of this mode is allowed 
to use. For example, transit routes with schedule mode bus can only use links with "bus" or "car" as modes. Similarly, all 
transit routes with the transport mode rail can only use rail links. If no assignment for a schedule transport mode is given, 
all transit routes using that mode are mapped with artificial links between stops.

To calculate the least cost paths as part of pseudo routing, a router is needed for every transport mode. To create these routers, 
mode separated networks are generated. Then an A\* router for each of these networks is initialized. The networks are filtered 
according to the _modeRoutingAssignment_. The router uses one of two link travel costs: either _linkLength_ or _travelTime_, 
defined in parameter _travelCostType_.

#### Pseudo routing
During this step the best sequence of link candidates for each transit route is calculated. While routing on the network uses 
an A\* router, least cost path search on the pseudo graph is done with a separate Dijkstra implementation.

Artificial links connect the _toNode_ of a link candidate with the _fromNode_ of the next link candidate. Artificial links 
are added to the network in two cases: When no path on the network between two link candidates can be found or if the least 
cost path has costs greater than a threshold. This threshold is defined as _maxTravelCostFactor_ times the minimal travel costs. 
The minimal travel costs depend on the parameter _travelCostType_: If it is _linkLength_, the beeline distance between the two 
stops is used. If it is _travelTime_, the minimal travel cost is equivalent to the travel time needed based on the arrival and 
departure offsets of the two stops. All artificial links (including loop links for stop facilities) and nodes have the prefix 
defined in _prefixArtificial_.

The step "PseudoRouting" creates _PseudoRoutes_ for each transit route, each of which contains a sequence of  _PseudoRouteStops_. 
A _PseudoRouteStop_ contains information on the stop facility, the link candidate as well as departure and arrival offsets.

This pseudo routing step can be parallelized using multiple threads (_numOfThreads_). For each thread a queue of transit lines is 
handled. However, the search for the shortest path between link candidates uses the routing algorithms provided in the MATSim core 
which are not thread safe. Access to the mode separated routers had to be synchronized.

After this step, all artificial links are added to the network. These links have a very low freespeed and an increased link length. 
This prevents transit routes from using these links unless they have to.  At this point, the link sequences for the transit 
routes have not yet been created. 

#### Child stop facilities and route profiles_
After all pseudoRoutes have been created, most likely there are multiple best links for a stop facility because different routes 
use different links. For each of these links a "child stop facility" is created. It has the same name and coordinate as its parent 
stop facility but it has a link referenced. The id of the child stop facility is generated by combining the parent stop id and the 
link id, connected by the string ".link:". For example the child stop facility of parent stop 64587 which is connected to the link 
432 would get the id "64587.link:432". Using the same connection string for all parts of the package allows to infer the parent 
stop id based on the given stop facility id.

Since it is now known which link candidates and thus child stop facility each transit route uses, route profiles (stop sequences) 
for all transit routes can be created.

#### Cleaning schedule and network_
Pseudo routing is finished after the previous steps. However, some artifacts remain in the schedule and the network. By default, 
stop facilities that are not used by any transit route are removed (_removeNotUsedStopFacilities_). The length of artificial 
links is reset to the Euclidian distance. During pseudo routing, the freespeed of artificial links has been set very low and 
has to be increased again. It is set according to the schedule: For all transit routes the minimal necessary freespeed to ensure 
they are on schedule is calculated. The highest minimal freespeed of all transit routes of a link is used as the link's freespeed. 
This process can be done for other link transport modes as well (defined in _scheduleFreespeedModes_). It is recommended to 
do this for rail.

The transport mode of each transit route is assigned to its used links. Links that are not used by a transit route are 
removed. This can clean up and simplify rail networks. Links which have a mode defined in _modesToKeepOnCleanup_ are kept 
regardless of public transit usage.

### Check Mapped Schedule Plausibility
While the TransitScheduleValidator is a good first indicator of the quality of a schedule, 
it does not check how plausible a transit route is. Possible implausibilities are for example if a 
route has loops, if sudden direction changes happen between links (u-turns) or if the travel times given 
by the schedule are cannot be met. If the travel time between two stops is higher than the scheduled time 
this points to either a too long (i.e. wrong) route or too low freespeed values on the network.

The package provides a plausibility check via 

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CheckMappedSchedulePlausibility
    
that looks for implausible parts of a route and warns accordingly. It needs the input:
	
    [0] schedule file
	[1] network file
	[2]	coordinate system (of both schedule and network)
	[3]	output folder

The following files are created in the ouput folder:

- _allPlausibilityWarnings.csv_: shows all plausibility warnings in a csv file
- _stopfacilities.csv_: the number of child stop facilities for all stop facilities as csv
- _stopfacilities_histogram.png_: a histogram as png showing the number of child stop facilities
- _shp/warnings/WarningsLoops.shp_: Loops warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/warnings/WarningsTravelTime.shp_: Travel time warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/warnings/WarningsDirectionChange.shp_: Direction change warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/schedule/TransitRoutes.shp_: Transit routes of the schedule as polyline shapefile
- _shp/schedule/StopFacilities.shp_: Stop Facilities as point shapefile
- _shp/schedule/StopFacilities_refLinks.shp_: The stop facilities' reference links as polyline shapefile

Shapefiles can be viewed in an GIS, a recommended open source GIS is QGIS. It is also possible to view them in senozon VIA.
However, no line attributes can be displayed or viewed there.
